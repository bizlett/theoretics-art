# **Theoretics Art**

![Mock up Theoretics Art]()

## **Goal for this project** 
Welcome to Theoretics Art, website and shop for Cardiff-based artist Chris Allen. 

Necessessarily playful, Chris creates standout, contemporary artwork that flirts with abstract and street art styles. Layers of acrylic and spray paint provide depth to the canvas, drawing the viewers eye to something new every time and creating a statement piece for your chosen space. 

A keen photographer, Chris also has a limited series of photographs available. Drawn from the natural world around us, Chris's photography captures both sweeping landscapes and the quiet detail of everyday moments. 

With a focus on a different persective, Theoretics Art aims to encourage discussion and evoke questions. Art is an open conversation, come share your opinion. 

Thank you for visiting my project!  
If you have any feedback or questions, head over to my GitHub contact details and feel free to reach out to me.

* I want to have some information about the artist and what motivates them.
* I want to have an intuitive navigation so I know right away where I can find which information or see my orders.
* I want to know what medium the paintings use.
* I want to know how big the painting is. 
* I want to order different size photos.
* I want to order multiple prints of photos. 
* I want to be able to buy the artwork directly.
* I want to be able to have all the information I need about delivery and what to expect from ordering from Theoretics Art.
* I want to be able to get in contact with the artist in case I have some questions.

### **Site owners Goals**

As an owner:  
* I want to promote my artwork in the best way possible to attract new customers.
* I want to increase direct sales by offering an online shop.
* I want to be able to see all the sales of artwork.
* I want to be able to easily be able to add new photography and artwork to the products to the shop.

### **Design Choices**

<a></a>

#### Colors

The artwork is the key to the design of this website. I chose a relatively muted colour scheme, drawing on the original artists logo. A monochrome theme, accented with gold, works well to help pop the artwork out of the page. I kept the rest of the site as clean as possible, using a white overlay on top of the landing page image to create a clean and simple background for the other pages and the artwork. The monochrome theme with gold accent persists in the overall theme through the buttons.

I have used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable. 

<a></a>


#### Fonts


<a></a>

#### Structure

* Landing / Home Page  
    The landing page image is a photograph of the artists materials placed amongst rubble to communicate the urban style and theme of the work. 
    A simple strapline tells the user they are on a the wesbsite of an artist who specialises in abstract art. 
    I included a button to take the user straight to the shop where the artwork speaks for itself.

* Shop  
    

* Shopping Bag  
   

* FAQs 
  

* About  
   

* Account page  
    

* Product management for admin

## Testing

## Bugs


## **Deployment**

### Local Deployment

I have created the project using Github, from there I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to write my code. 
Then I used commits to git followed by "git push" to my GitHub repository. 
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used "git push heroku master" to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku. 

For this project you need to create an account on Stripe for the reservation module as well as an account on AWS in order to store your static and media files.

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps: 
I used Gitpod for development, so the following steps will be specific to Gitpod. 
You will need to adjust them depending on your IDE. You can find more information about installing packages using pip and virtual environments [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

To clone the project: 

1. From the application's repository, click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository.
    Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:

    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/bizlett/theoretics-art.git
    ``` 

1. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's [link to required modules](https://github.com/bizlett/theoretics-art/blob/master/requirements.txt) using the following command:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. 
    It will need to contain the following lines and variables:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"

    os.environ["DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL"] = 'DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL'

    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "STRIPE_WH_SECRET"
    os.environ["STRIPE_CURRENCY"] = "EUR"

    ```
    
    If you're not sure how to get the above Stripe variables, please visit the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs)

    If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.

1. Migrate the database models with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
1. Create a superuser and set up the credentials with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
1. Run the app with the following command
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The address to access the website is displayed in the terminal  
    Add /admin to the end to access the admin panel with your superuser credentials

    
### Heroku Deployment 

1. Login to your Heroku account and create a new app. Choose your region. 
1. Once the app is created click on the resources button and under Add-ons, look for the Heroku Postgres to attach a postgres database to your project.
    Select the Hobby Dev - Free plan and click 'Submit order form'

    ![Heroku Postgress Add on](/images-readme/heroku-postgress-addon.png)

1. Scroll back up and click "settings". Scroll down and click "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your env.py ():
    !You shouldn't set the DEBUG variable in under config vars, only in your env.py to prevent DEBUG being active on live website. 

    ```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = "AWS_S3_REGION_NAME"
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = "AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME"
    USE_AWS = True
    
    DATABASE_URL = "This variable is automatically set when adding the Postgres Add on"

    SECRET_KEY = "SECRET_KEY"

    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = "STRIPE_WH_SECRET"
    STRIPE_CURRENCY = EUR

    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL"
    EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
    EMAIL_HOST_PASS = "EMAIL_HOST_PASS"
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = "EMAIL_HOST_USER"
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    ```
1. From this screen, copy the value of DATABASE_URL
1. After this go to your settings.py the theoretics_art directory and comment out the default database configuration and add:
    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse('Put your DATABASE_URL here'))
    }
    ```
1. Migrate again with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```


1. Create a superuser for the postgres database so you can have access to the django admin by setting up the credentials with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    --> Don't forget to login to the admin page and check the boxes 'Verified and primary"

1. Load the data into your newly created database by using the following command: 

    ```
    python3 manage.py loaddata <name of file containing the data *>
    ``` 

    * tourist_info_datadump.json
    * home_datadump.json
    * rooms_datadump.json
    * gallery_datadump.json

1. After migrations are complete, change database configurations to:
```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        }
```
This set up will allow your site to use Postgres in deployment and sqlite3 in development.


1. Make sure you have your requirements.txt file and your Procfile. In case you don't, follow the below steps:
    Requirements:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    Procfile:
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
1. The Procfile should contain the following line:
    ```
    web: gunicorn <project_name>.wsgi:application

    ```

1. Add your files and commit them to GITHUB by running the following commands:
    ```
    git add . 
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push
    ```

1. Add your Heroku app URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS in your settings.py file
1. Disable collect static so that Heroku doesn't try to collect static files when you deploy by typing the following command in the terminal
    ```
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
    ```
1. Go back to HEROKU and click "Deploy" in the navigation. 
1. Scroll down to Deployment method and Select Github. 
1. Look for your repository and click connect. 
1. Under automatic deploys, click 'Enable automatic deploys'

1. Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.
1. In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push to push your changes. 


1. Store your static files and media files on AWS. You can find more information about this on [Amazon S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html).
    If you would like to follow a tutorial instead, visit [this tutorial on Youtube from Amazon Web Services](https://youtube.com/watch?v=e6w9LwZJFIA)

1. Set up email service to send confirmation email and user verification email to the users. You can do this by following the next steps (Gmail only)

(Be aware that this migth be different for other providers or the process might have changed over time)

* Go to your email account and go to your account settings
* Under Security, scroll down to Signing in to Google and make sure 2 step verification is turned on
* Under the same heading (Signing in to Google) you will see the 'App passwords' option.
* Click on the option, select mail for the app and under device type select other and fill in 'Django'
* You will now get a password which you should copy and set it as a config variable in Heroku:

```
    EMAIL_HOST_PASS = 'Password you just copied'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'Your gmail account
```
* Go to your settings.py in theoretics_art directory and add the following:

```
    if "DEVELOPMENT" in os.environ:
        EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
        DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL')
    else:
        EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
        EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
        EMAIL_PORT = 587
        EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
        EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
        EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')
        DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL')
```
